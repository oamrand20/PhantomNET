## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Payload Delivery**  
   Use the web interface to send phishing emails or manually deliver the payload (e.g., via Phishing email).

2. **Victim Connection**  
   Once the payload runs on the target machine, it reports the IP back to the control server.
   `Persistent Reverse¬†HTTPS¬†Backdoor` 

3. **Command Access**  
   Paste the victim‚Äôs IP into the CLI page:  
   `yourDomain/admin/cli`  
   You now have reverse shell access.
   Shell Type:
   ` Python Reverse Shell subprocess` 

4. **Available Actions**
   - Scan Netowrk
   - Ransomware (Encrypt/Decrypt files)
   - Capture Screenshots
   - Activate Webcam
   - Start/Stop Keylogger & Upload Logs
   - Upload/Download Files
   - Execute Custom Commands
   - System Reconnaissance
   - Clear Traces
   - Sysinfo and VulnScan
   - Add/Extend Functionalities

  - Integration-ready with browser-based CLI panel

Directory Structure:
```
root/control-server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Server_C2.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/
```
---
How to Run:

```
# open port 5000
sudo ufw allow 5000

#install python library
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml

#run server
python Server_C2.py

```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Victim Bot Payload


Tech Stack: Python 3.10+, PyInstaller (for EXE conversion)
Role: Connects to the C2 backend and executes commands sent by the operator.

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/
```
How to Run (Dev Mode):

# On Windows (after setting SERVER_URL):
```
python SecurityInfo.py
```
How to Compile to non console (Windows):
```
just rename the file to `SecurityInfo.pyw`
and run it by click or open Run (Win+R)
pythonw "C:\Users\omar\Desktop\SecurityInfo.pyw"
```
Note: Make sure SERVER_URL in the bot script points to your C2 server (e.g., https://192.168.0.22:5000).

## üì° Server Communication

All three main components (Client, Backend, Control) communicate through **RESTful APIs**. The fourth component (Victim Bot) connects to the Control Server upon execution.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

### Front-End
- Node.js
- npm

### Back-End
- PHP
- Composer
- MySQL or compatible DB

---

## üìç Final Notes

- All credentials and sensitive variables should be set in `.env` files.
- Be cautious when editing `_document.js` ‚Äì it controls the PWA behavior.
